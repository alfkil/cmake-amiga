=== How to install :

Add the following to your s:user-startup :

;BEGIN CMake-3.29
;assign home: work4.1:home
assign cmake-amiga: work4.1:cmake-amiga
setenv PATH /SDK/gcc/bin:/SDK/C:/SDK/local/C:/cmake-amiga/bin
path cmake-amiga:bin ADD
;END CMake-3.29

You need to edit this to fit your system.

Make sure, that there is a ".unix" file in /cmake-amiga/bin :

touch cmake-amiga:bin/.unix

That's it!
