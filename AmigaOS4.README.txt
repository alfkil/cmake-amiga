=== How to install :

Add the following to your s:user-startup :

;BEGIN CMake-3.29
;assign home: work4.1:home
assign cmake-amiga: work4.1:cmake-amiga
setenv PATH /SDK/gcc/bin:/SDK/C:/SDK/local/C:/cmake-amiga/bin
path cmake-amiga:bin ADD
;END CMake-3.29

You need to edit this to fit your system.

You also need to copy the supplied version of clib4.library to libs:
This is only until there is a stable, public release of clib4 that supports cmake.

And last : You need to add something like

stack 4000000

to your s:shell-startup

That's it!

NB: You no longer need the .unix file.
